HiðŸ‘‹, My name is JJ! Welcome to my GitHub page.

I see myself as a passionate software enthusiast. I believe that anything can be solved with software. 
With that, I strive to learn as much as possible. 

I started with web pursuing C# MVC and the slowly started developing mobile applications with web services. 

I picked up new skills as I needed them. Skills like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to manage and edit my application assets to avoid missing deadlines due to editors taking time. 
I manage pressure quite wel as I worked as a support technician while managing software clients. 

I believe that rapid learning is fantastic and that you will always learn something new that you never used previously.

My ability to work in a team grew significantly after starting at Singular Systems. From working with elegant software approaches to in depth planning in teams of up to 20 people.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in in various technologiy stacts related to .NET. I am extremely facinated by the ability to create literally anything using C#.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Blazor Server, WASM and Maui Blazor. I am having an absolute blast using these technologies as it allows me to build fully capable software for any scale!
